# Capture Nasa 
A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project. View a [live demo here](https://louiewhitz.github.io/capture-nasa/).

This project is a web application that allows users to view  NASA's image or video of the day, save their favorite image or video to a favorites page, and search for past images or videos.This application is fully responsive design for optimal viewing on any device.

Capture Nasa was built using simple front end technologies implementing AJAX requests to [NASA's APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/) in order to vie NASA's image and/or video of the day and search by day, month and year in the past. Furthermore, on the homepage, each time the page loads, another AJAX request is sent to [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/random) in order to fetch an inspiring quote. NASA has only been uploading media since 1995, so there is functionality built in to inform the user should they search any days prior. All styling is built with custom HTML and CSS for structure and design, without external libraries. Initially, the project was written in Vanilla ES5, however, it has recently been converted to ES6. For anyone looking to have a quick recap on the variable 'var' is welcome to change each 'const' and 'let' and the project will perform in the same manner.
